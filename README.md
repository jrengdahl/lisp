This is a Lisp interpreter I wrote for the Amiga in 1987. It was written in 68000 assembly code. It was as fast as VaxLisp, though it was much less complete,
and sacrificed some intrinsic safety for speed. It implements a subset of Common Lisp as it existed back then.

Also included are a few tools, including a structured assembly preprocessor.

The source was released publicly on BIX (Byte Information Exchange), back in the days of 1200 baud modems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Information_Exchange).

I have not run it in decades. It is not in a working condition, and I'm even having a hard time, 31 years later, remembering what some of the code does.
(Who wrote this stuff? Why are there no comments?)

I've started porting it to C++.
